# pmDuo

pmDuo is a dual sport app. Designed to record both a cycle and a run, with a transition inbetween (although the transition doesn't seem to create a FIT file, I'm assuming this is something to do with ConnectIQ).

## Usage

Once started, the GPS will try and connect, the red bar above the phase chevrons indicates GPS signal, and will turn yellow or green when a signal is acquired.
To start your cycle, press the "Enter" button (physical button on the right side of the vivoactive).
At the end of your cycle, press the button again to save the cycle and start the transition phase. There may be a delay before this starts due to the saving of the cycle (I'm afraid there's not much I can do about that)
When you are ready to start your run, press the button again, and it will start recording.
Press the button a final time at the end of your run to save the run data, and you will be presented on-screen with the total time, with phase split times.

## Onscreen Data

Currently the only information available to display are:
    Event (Total) Time
    Discipline (Phase) Time
    Pace (time per mi/km based on watch setting)
    Distance (mi/km based on watch setting)




## Watch Support
It has only actually been tested on a Vivoactive, but should support all square screen watches
